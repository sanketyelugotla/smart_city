                This is the first time, a MoUD programme is using the ‘Challenge’ or competition method to select cities
                for funding and using a strategy of area-based development. This captures the spirit of ‘competitive and
                cooperative federalism’.<br /><br />

                States and ULBs will play a key supportive role in the development of Smart Cities. Smart leadership and
                vision at this level and ability to act decisively will be important factors determining the success of
                the Mission.<br /><br />

                Understanding the concepts of retrofitting, redevelopment and greenfield development by the policy
                makers, implementers and other stakeholders at different levels will require capacity
                assistance.<br /><br />

                Major investments in time and resources will have to be made during the planning phase prior to
                participation in the Challenge. This is different from the conventional DPR-driven approach.<br /><br />

                The Smart Cities Mission requires smart people who actively participate in governance and reforms.
                Citizen involvement is much more than a ceremonial participation in governance. Smart people involve
                themselves in the definition of the Smart City, decisions on deploying Smart Solutions, implementing
                reforms, doing more with less and oversight during implementing and designing post-project structures in
                order to make the Smart City developments sustainable. The participation of smart people will be enabled
                by the SPV through increasing use of ICT, especially mobile-based tools.<br /><br />
