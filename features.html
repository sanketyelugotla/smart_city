            <!-- <div >
                    Some typical features of comprehensive development in Smart Cities are described below.
                </div> -->
            <ol id="para" style="line-height: 2em; list-style: decimal">
                <li>Promoting mixed land use in area based developments–planning for ‘unplanned areas’ containing a
                    range of compatible activities and land uses close to one another in order to make land use more
                    efficient. The States will enable some flexibility in land use and building bye-laws to adapt to
                    change;</li>
                <li>Housing and inclusiveness - expand housing opportunities for all;</li>
                <li>Creating walkable localities –reduce congestion, air pollution and resource depletion, boost local
                    economy, promote interactions and ensure security. The road network is created or refurbished not
                    only for vehicles and public transport, but also for pedestrians and cyclists, and necessary
                    administrative services are offered within walking or cycling distance;</li>
                <li>Preserving and developing open spaces - parks, playgrounds, and recreational spaces in order to
                    enhance the quality of life of citizens, reduce the urban heat effects in Areas and generally
                    promote eco-balance;</li>
                <li>Promoting a variety of transport options - Transit Oriented Development (TOD), public transport and
                    last mile para-transport connectivity;</li>
                <li>Making governance citizen-friendly and cost effective - increasingly rely on online services to
                    bring about accountability and transparency, especially using mobiles to reduce cost of services and
                    providing services without having to go to municipal offices. Forming e-groups to listen to people
                    and obtain feedback and use online monitoring of programs and activities with the aid of cyber tour
                    of worksites;</li>
                <li>Giving an identity to the city - based on its main economic activity, such as local cuisine, health,
                    education, arts and craft, culture, sports goods, furniture, hosiery, textile, dairy, etc;</li>
                <li>Applying Smart Solutions to infrastructure and services in area-based development in order to make
                    them better. For example, making Areas less vulnerable to disasters, using fewer resources, and
                    providing cheaper services.</li>
