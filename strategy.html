                The strategic components of area-based development in the Smart Cities Mission are city improvement
                (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (greenfield development) plus a Pan-city
                initiative in which Smart Solutions are applied covering larger parts of the city. Below are given the
                deions of the three models of Area-based smart city development:<br /><br />

                Retrofitting will introduce planning in an existing built-up area to achieve smart city objectives,
                along with other objectives, to make the existing area more efficient and liveable. In retrofitting, an
                area consisting of more than 500 acres will be identified by the city in consultation with citizens.
                Depending on the existing level of infrastructure services in the identified area and the vision of the
                residents, the cities will prepare a strategy to become smart. Since existing structures are largely to
                remain intact in this model, it is expected that more intensive infrastructure service levels and a
                large number of smart applications will be packed into the retrofitted smart city. This strategy may
                also be completed in a shorter time frame, leading to its replication in another part of the
                city.<br /><br />
                Redevelopment will effect a replacement of the existing built-up environment and enable co-creation of a
                new layout with enhanced infrastructure using mixed land use and increased density. Redevelopment
                envisages an area of more than 50 acres, identified by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in consultation with
                citizens. For instance, a new layout plan of the identified area will be prepared with mixed land-use,
                higher FSI and high ground coverage. Two examples of the redevelopment model are the Saifee Burhani
                Upliftment Project in Mumbai (also called the Bhendi Bazaar Project) and the redevelopment of East
                Kidwai Nagar in New Delhi being undertaken by the National Building Construction
                Corporation.<br /><br />
                Greenfield development will introduce most of the Smart Solutions in a previously vacant area (more than
                250 acres) using innovative planning, plan financing and plan implementation tools (e.g. land pooling/
                land reconstitution) with provision for affordable housing, especially for the poor. Greenfield
                developments are required around cities in order to address the needs of the expanding population. One
                well known example is the GIFT City in Gujarat. Unlike retrofitting and redevelopment,
                greenfield developments could be located either within the limits of the ULB or within the limits of the
                local Urban Development Authority (UDA).<br /><br />
                Pan-city development envisages application of selected Smart Solutions to the existing city-wide
                infrastructure. Application of Smart Solutions will involve the use of technology, information and data
                to make infrastructure and services better. For example, applying Smart Solutions in the transport
                sector (intelligent traffic management system) and reducing average commute time or cost of citizens
                will have positive effects on productivity and quality of life of citizens. Another example can be waste
                water recycling and smart metering which can make a huge contribution to better water management in the
                city.<br /><br />
                The smart city proposal of each shortlisted city is expected to encapsulate either a retrofitting or
                redevelopment or greenfield development model, or a mix thereof and a Pan-city feature with Smart
                Solution(s). It is important to note that pan-city is an additional feature to be provided. Since smart
                city is taking a compact area approach, it is necessary that all the city residents feel there is
                something in it for them also. Therefore, the additional requirement of some (at least one) city-wide
                smart solution has been put in the scheme to make it inclusive.<br /><br />
                For North Eastern and Himalayan States, the area proposed to be developed will be one-half of what is
                prescribed for any of the alternative models - retrofitting, redevelopment or greenfield
                development.<br /><br />
