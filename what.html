            <p id="para">
                The first question is what is meant by a ‘smart city’. The answer is, there is no universally accepted
                definition of a smart city. It means different things to different people. The conceptualisation of
                Smart City, therefore, varies from city to city and country to country, depending on the level of
                development, willingness to change and reform, resources and aspirations of the city residents. A smart
                city would have a different connotation in India than, say, Europe. Even in India, there is no one way
                of defining a smart city.<br /><br />


                Some definitional boundaries are required to guide cities in the Mission. In the imagination of any city
                dweller in India, the picture of a smart city contains a wish list of infrastructure and services that
                describes his or her level of aspiration. To provide for the aspirations and needs of the citizens,
                urban planners ideally aim at developing the entire urban eco-system, which is represented by the four
                pillars of comprehensive development-institutional, physical, social and economic infrastructure. This
                can be a long term goal and cities can work towards developing such comprehensive infrastructure
                incrementally, adding on layers of ‘smartness’.<br /><br />

                In the approach to the Smart Cities Mission, the objective is to promote cities that provide
                core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable
                environment and application of ‘Smart’ Solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive
                development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model which will
                act like a light house to other aspiring cities. The Smart Cities Mission of the Government
                is a bold, new initiative. It is meant to set examples that can be replicated both within and
                outside the Smart City, catalysing the creation of similar Smart Cities in various regions and
                parts of the country <br><br>

                The core infrastructure elements in a Smart City would include: <br>

                i. adequate water supply,<br>
                ii. assured electricity supply,<br>
                iii. sanitation, including solid waste management,<br>
                iv. efficient urban mobility and public transport,<br>
                v. affordable housing, especially for the poor,<br>
                vi. robust IT connectivity and digitalization,<br>
                vii. good governance, especially e-Governance and citizen participation,<br>
                viii. sustainable environment,<br>
                ix. safety and security of citizens, particularly women, children and the elderly, and<br>
                x. health and education.<br>
